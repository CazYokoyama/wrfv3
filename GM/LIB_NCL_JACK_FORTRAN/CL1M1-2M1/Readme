Files are marked as:

nocuda - version that is not using cuda
avx - compiled for Intel AVX capable processors (newest corei7 and Xeon) ,
 	will crash otherwise with "Illegal Instruction".
sse2 - optimized for sse2, it means - for all


So, you need one from both, ncl_jack and wrf_user, on your linking path
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is variable to add a directory to



Setup for Nvidia:
those are linked against libcudart.so.4, so you need cuda version 4.0
 5.0 is out, but there is some library incompatibility
 it may work if you symlink your libcudart.so.5 to libcudart.so.4
